# Namaste React ðŸš€

1. What is the diff b/w `package.json` & `package-lock.json`?

- `package.json`:
  - configuration file for npm, containing approx version of package installed.
  - Every dependecies has `package.json` in their directory.
- `package-lock.json`: - contains track of exact version of each package installed to avoid any build error in production.
- Both files need to be pushed to github.

2. What are the use cases of `parcel` package?

- Dev build
- Local sever
- HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- It uses a file watching algorithm (written in C++)
- Faster build (Caching)
- Image Optimization
- Minification
- Compressing
- Content hashing
- Code splitting
- Differetial bundling (To support older browsers)
- Diagnostic
- Error handling
- Allow HTTPs server
- Tree shaking (remove unused code)
- `Note`: When doing prod build using command `npx parcel build index.html` error will pop, because of 1 config: `main: App.js` in `package.json` file. So we need to remove the line.

3. What is a `React Element`?

- Its an object. But when it endered to browser then it converts to html.

4. What is `JSX` ?

- Easier way to write react code for html element.
- Make the developers life easy.
- JSX is not HTML inside Javascript, but HTML/XML like syntax.
- Both will print same object. But since jsx format is more readable so we are going to use it.
  ```
    const heading = React.createElement(
    'h1',
    { id: 'heading' },
    'Namaste React ðŸš€'
    );
    const jsxHeaing = <h1 id="heading">Namaste React ðŸš€</h1>;
    console.log(heading);
    console.log(jsxHeaing);
  ```
- Browser can not understand JSX, but behind the scene `babel`(JS compiler) is doing the job.
- `babel` transpile the JSX code to ReactElement before sending to the `js engine`, so that js engine can understand it. `babel` is required by `parcel`.
- JSX => transpiled to React element => JS element => rendered as HTML element
- We have to use `camelCase` while `assigning attributes to JSX`.
- To write JSX in multiple lines we need to wrap it around `()`.
- JSX `sanitize` the data to avoid `cross site scripting`.

5. React Component(2 types)

- class based component(old way)
- functional component(latest standard)
  - normal js function that returns a JSX code/ React element(s).
  - ex:
  ```
    const FunctionalComponent = () => {
      return (some JSX)
    }
  ```
- Components can be used inside other component (Also called component composition)
  ```
    const TitleComponent = () => (
      <h1 id="heading" className="heading" tabIndex={1}>
        Namaste React ðŸš€ using JSX
      </h1>
    );
    const HeadingComponent = () => (
      <div>
        <TitleComponent /> or {TitleComponent()}
        <h1 id="heading" className="heading" tabIndex={1}>
          Namaste React Functional Component
        </h1>
      </div>
    );
  ```
- Components can be rendered using the syntax `root.render(<HeadingComponent />);`

6. How to put ReactElement inside a ReactComponent & vice versa?

- ```
    const Title =(
      <h1 id="heading" className="heading" tabIndex={1}>
        Namaste React ðŸš€ using JSX
      </h1>
    );
    const HeadingComponent = () => (
      <div>
        {Title}
        <h1 id="heading" className="heading" tabIndex={1}>
          Namaste React Functional Component
        </h1>
      </div>
    );
  ```
- Same for putting one ReactElement inside another.

7. What is `React Fragment` ?

- Used to wrap multiple html elements with out any div tag.
- Behaves as an empty tag.
- ```
    <React.Fragment>
      <div>Hello</hello>
      <div>I am Satya</hello>
    </React.Fragment>
  ```

- The above can be written like(`<>` is short hand for `<React.Fragment>`)
  ```
    <>
      <div>Hello</hello>
      <div>I am Satya</hello>
    </>
  ```

8. `Config Driven UI`:

- UI is driven by api response.

9. Why we need `key` when iterating ?(very important)

- Each List items/components need to represented uniquely to optimize the rendering cycle.
- When ever we write a map write a key for each item.
- Don't use index as a key.

10. Type of export?

- Default :
  - synatx: export default EXPORT_NAME
  - Used when only 1 export is there
- Named :
  - syntax: export EXPORT_NAME
  - Used when multiple exports are there

11. Why react is fast?

- It can do `efficient DOM manipulation`.

12. What is a `React Hook` ?

- A normal js utility function by react to for state management.
- 2 hooks that are mostly used:

  - `useState()` - Superpowerful state variable

    - syntax:

    ```
      const [restaurantList, functionToUpdateStateVariable] = useState(defaultValue);
    ```

    - ex:

    ```
      import restaurants from '../../restaurants.json';
      import RestaurantCard from './RestaurantCard';
      import { useState } from 'react';

      const Body = () => {
        // Local state variable
        const [restaurantList, setRestaurantList] = useState(restaurants);

        return (
          <div className="body">
            <div className="filter">
              <button
                className="filter-btn"
                onClick={() => {
                  const filteredList = restaurants.filter(
                    (res) => res.data.avgRating > 4
                  );
                  setRestaurantList(filteredList);
                }}
              >
                Top Rated Restaurants
              </button>
            </div>
            <div className="res-container">
              {/* Restaurant Card */}
              {restaurantList.map((restaurant) => (
                <RestaurantCard key={restaurant.data.id} resData={restaurant} />
              ))}
            </div>
          </div>
        );
      };
    ```

    - We can not update function assigned with useState()
    - Whenever any state variable changes react re-render the UI.
    - React refresh the required Component only, not any other components(i.e. if a state variable is in `Header Component` then react will only refresh Hedaer component only).

  - `useEffect()` - Call a function when dependencies chnaged
    - syntax
    ```
      useEffect(() => {
        console.log('call this when dependecy variables changes')
      }, [dependecyVariable])
    ```
  - If no dependecy then callback function will be called only once & will be called after render.
  - If dependecy present then callback function will be called once after initial render + everytime after re-render.
  - Application: (To do API call once page rendered)

  ```
    useEffect(() => {
     // API call
    }, [])
  ```

13. What is `React Fiber`?

- Also known as `Reconciliation Algorithm`. - came up in react 16
- React creates a virtual DOM (represenatation of actual DOM, is a nested object).
- This algo find the diff b/w old & new virtual DOM & optimally update the DOM.

14. Shimmer Effect in UI.

- It is used when there is no data.

15. Conditional rendering.
